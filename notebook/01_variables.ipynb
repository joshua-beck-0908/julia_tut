    " * *Word separation can be indicated by underscores ('_'), but use of underscores is discouraged unless the name would be hard to read otherwise.*\n",
    "    - I¬†will be using long descriptive names not some unreadable C-style terse shitshow.\n",
    "    - With the exception of those that can be represented a more appropriate greek letter.\n",
    " * *Names of Types and Modules begin with a capital letter and word separation is shown with upper camel case instead of underscores.*\n",
    "    - A little inconsistant, but I can see the logic behind it.\n",
    " * *Names of functions and macros are in lower case, without underscores.*\n",
    "    - My brain keeps try to find a way I've misread that, but no.\n",
    "    - Zero word separation?! That's just a straight up bad idea. Yikes.\n",
    "    - It's important to remember style guides are just a suggestions.\n",
    " * *Functions that write to their arguments have names that end in !. These are sometimes called \"mutating\" or \"in-place\" functions because they are intended to produce changes in their arguments after the function is called, not just return a value.*\n",
    "    - The function... name changes? Not the parameter being modified?\n",
    "    - Well, it's a good idea to point out argument modification, but surely a parameter keyword (ideally enforced by the compiler) would be better?\n",
    "    \n",
    "I'm not exactly filled with confidence about the community code after reading this."
